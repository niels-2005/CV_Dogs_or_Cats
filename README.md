# CV_Dogs_or_Cats

Welcome to the **CV_Dogs_or_Cats** repository! This project leverages deep learning techniques using TensorFlow and EfficientNetB0 to classify images as either dogs or cats. The objective is to demonstrate image classification with transfer learning, fine-tuning, and the handling of imbalanced datasets.

## Project Overview

**CV_Dogs_or_Cats** utilizes a pre-trained model, EfficientNetB0, as the backbone for feature extraction on a dataset consisting of dog and cat images. The model is then fine-tuned to accurately classify between these two categories using TensorFlow.

## Features

- **EfficientNet Feature Extraction**: Uses EfficientNetB0 pre-trained on ImageNet for robust feature extraction.
- **Binary Classification**: Classifies images into two categories, dogs and cats.
- **Data Handling**: Includes scripts for preprocessing data, handling imbalanced datasets, and augmenting images to improve model robustness.
- **Performance Visualization**: Provides utility functions to plot training and validation loss and accuracy, helping in monitoring model performance.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises thousands of labeled images of dogs and cats, split into training, validation, and testing sets to ensure model generalization.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture is built on TensorFlowâ€™s Sequential API, incorporating the following layers:
- **GlobalAveragePooling2D**: Reduces feature map dimensionality.
- **Dense Layers**: For learning non-linear combinations of features.
- **Dropout**: To reduce overfitting.
- **Output Layer**: A single neuron with a sigmoid activation function to output the classification probability.

## Training and Evaluation

Model training involves:
- **Binary Crossentropy**: As the loss function to handle the binary classification task.
- **Adam Optimizer**: For efficient stochastic gradient descent.
- **Accuracy Metrics**: To evaluate model performance.

After training, the model is evaluated on a separate test dataset to assess its generalization capability.

## Conclusion

The **CV_Dogs_or_Cats** project is designed to provide insights into building and tuning a deep learning model for a simple yet common task in computer vision: binary image classification. The application of transfer learning and subsequent fine-tuning exemplifies how pre-trained models can be leveraged to achieve high accuracy in specific tasks.
